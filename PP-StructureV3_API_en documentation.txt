Main operations provided by the service:

The HTTP request method is POST.
Both the request body and response body are in JSON format (JSON object).
When the request is processed successfully, the response status code is 200, and the response body contains the following properties:
Name	Type	Description
logId	string	The UUID of the request.
errorCode	integer	Error code. Always 0.
errorMsg	string	Error description: Always "Success".
result	object	Operation result.
When the request is not processed successfully, the response body contains the following properties:
Name	Type	Description
logId	string	The UUID of the request.
errorCode	integer	Error code. Same as the response status code.
errorMsg	string	Error description.
Main operations provided by the service are as follows:
